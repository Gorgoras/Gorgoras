# Hola!! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! :D My name is Martin Zurita and I'm a Data Engineer. 

I have previous experience working as a dev, Bi consultant and some Data Science, but Data Engineering is where I'm most comfortable at and what I love to do. I like everything that involves data movement, cleaning, ETL processes, orchestration and integration of data coming from different sources.
