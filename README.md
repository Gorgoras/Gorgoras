# Hola!! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! :D My name is Martin Zurita and I'm an Azure Data Solutions Architect. 

I have previous experience working as a dev, Bi consultant and some Data Science, but Data Engineering is where I'm most comfortable at and what I love to do. I'm currently designing data architectures based on business requirements and leading a small (but powerfull!) team at the company I'm working at. I am passionate about everything that involves data movement, cleaning, ETL processes, orchestration, integration and automation of data coming from different sources. 

## More about me:

- ðŸŒ± Always learning something new on Azure ![Azure][1.1], Python ![Python][1.2] and Databricks![DataBricks][1.3]!! I have some useful repos and gists (and some not so useful), so feel free to use anything you find here.

- Azure Certified Data Engineer! 
![Data-Eng][1.4]

- I'm coding my own Python library to make Azure Tables a more accessible technology (linking it with Pandas), as I think it is really underused and not taken into consideration enough. https://pypi.org/project/pdAzTables/

- I'm also the nerd with most answers on StackOverflow in the Data Factory V2 tag! ðŸ˜„ https://stackoverflow.com/tags/azure-data-factory-2/topusers

- I'm a fan of building small tools to help people in everyday things, the most recent example is my Telegram chatbot. Just send it a picture and the bot will return the same image but mirrored! There are a lot of tools to do this but most non-technical people struggle with these sort of things. Useful when taking a selfie against a sign!! ðŸ˜„ Use it for free here: http://t.me/imageflippy_bot

- &#x270d; I like writing blogs about data and general cloud configuration. Almost always it is in Spanish but Google Translate will make sure you can read them in any language ðŸ˜„. Here are my blog posts:
